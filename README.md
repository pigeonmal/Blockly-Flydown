# Blockly-Flydown
Blockly flydown is a field system that lets you hover your mouse over it to open a gui, where you can put any block in it, and can be transferred to the main workspace. (**This code does not need any dependency other than Blockly and closure**)

This one could be created from [appinventor](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources), and with the participation of the following authors:
- [Lyn Turbak](fturbak@wellesley.edu) (AppInventor)
- Pigeonmal
- [Beka Westberg](http://bekawestberg.me/)
- Abby Schmiedt

## INSTALATION

First, add the two files **custom_fields.js** and **custom_flydown.js** and don't forget to implement them in your head in index.html:

    <script  src="custom_flydown.js"></script>
    <script  src="custom_fields.js"></script>
